This is a copy of a Fortran code that implements solution of the spatially homogeous Boltzmann equation using nodal-Discontinuous 
Galerkin discretization in velocity variable and Runge-Kutta/Adam-Bashforth integration in time. The code includes several models for 
evaluating the Boltzmann collision operator: the full Boltzmann collision operator for binary collisions (hard--spheres are currently 
supported), linearized collision operator, BGk, ES-BGK, and model collision operator with enforced relaxation rates for moments. 

Methods for discretization of the Boltzmann collision operator that are used in this code were reported in following papers:
